advanced datatypes in ts:-
type:- defining types in ts 
how is it different from tuples?
tuples are used to store data of different datatypes in an array, 
usually used to store information about something in short way.

types help us define a type for multiple vars
type is more similar to classes in oop type programming languages
this where we can define all the properties and methods of those types

readonly properties are like constants in c

union types in tsc
can be anotated using | 
example:-
function kgtolbs(weight:number | string):number{}
after compilation the compiler does the type checking and removes the type for js code

intersection types in tsc
& helps us declare an object of multiple types(practically useless)
this can be very useful if the multiple types are userdefined
the type defined using another types should implement its methods when an object s created of its type

literal types in tsc:-
used to specify the type in more detail
example:-
type gravity = 9.18;
type pi = 3.14 | 22/7; // this is wrong 
//and if try to circumvent it as follows
// const p = 22/7; // using this doesn't make any sense
// type pi = 3.142 | typeof p; //this just takes of type number so it isn't literal

nullable types in tsc:-
