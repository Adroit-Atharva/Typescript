typescript is simply better than javascript 
javascript is for savages with no discipline
typrscript is for gentlemen.
ts is more strict and needs a compiler 
ts is a super set of js 
the compiler of ts converts the ts code into js code
by default ts uses an older verison of javascript which is called es5.


configuring the ts compiler:-
use tsconfig.json to configure the file
used to specify the input directory and the output directory for the ts compiler

debugging using vs code and nodejs
-shows us how the values of the vars change as the lines within the code are executed

datatypes in ts:-
number
string
boolean
any (avoid using it cause it defeats the purpose of using ts in the first place)
array (linear sequence of similar datatypes)
tuples (linear sequence of heterogenous datatypes) like structures in c
